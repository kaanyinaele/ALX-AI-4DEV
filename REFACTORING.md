# Project Refactoring Summary

## 1. Centralized Supabase Client Management

- Created a centralized module for Supabase client management in `/src/lib/supabase/index.ts`
- Implemented retry logic for better resilience against transient failures
- Added proper error handling and logging
- Created a service layer pattern for database operations

## 2. Improved Type Safety

- Created a comprehensive type definitions file in `/src/lib/types.ts`
- Added proper interfaces for all data structures
- Created custom error types for different error scenarios
- Ensured type safety across the application

## 3. Implemented Error Handling Strategy

- Created a centralized error handling utility in `/src/lib/utils/error-handling.ts`
- Implemented user-friendly error messages
- Added proper error logging
- Created a consistent error handling pattern for server actions

## 4. Created Services Layer

- Added `AuthService` for authentication-related operations
- Added `PollService` for poll-related operations
- Moved business logic from components and server actions to services
- Implemented proper error handling and retries in services

## 5. Custom React Hooks

- Created `useAuth` hook for authentication state and operations
- Created `usePoll` hooks for poll data management
- Created `usePollVoting` hook for voting functionality
- Separated UI from business logic

## 6. Updated Components

- Updated `VotePollForm` component to use the new hooks and utilities
- Improved error handling in components
- Simplified component logic by leveraging hooks

## 7. Improved Authentication

- Updated the `AuthProvider` component to use the new services
- Added comprehensive authentication flow
- Improved error handling and user feedback

## 8. Updated Server Actions

- Refactored `createPoll` and `updatePoll` actions to use the new services
- Improved error handling in server actions
- Added proper type safety

## 9. Added Documentation

- Created `ARCHITECTURE.md` to document the application architecture
- Documented code organization and best practices
- Provided guidance for future development

## Benefits of These Refactors

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Code is more organized with clear separation of concerns
2. **Better Error Handling**: Consistent approach to errors with user-friendly messages
3. **Enhanced Type Safety**: Stronger typing reduces runtime errors
4. **Code Reusability**: Common logic is extracted into reusable services and hooks
5. **Resilience**: Added retry logic for better handling of transient failures
6. **Documentation**: Better documentation for easier onboarding of new developers

## Next Steps

1. Continue updating remaining components and pages
2. Implement optimistic UI updates for better user experience
3. Add more comprehensive test coverage
4. Enhance performance monitoring
5. Improve accessibility
